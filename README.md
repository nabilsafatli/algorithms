# Algorithms
This repository contains algorithms of solved exercises.

To stay sharp and improve my knowledge about data structures I solve different challenges frequently, and I will make this repository open with the solutions to inspire others as well.

I intend to do that in different languages.

## Objective-C
- Sock Merchant _from Hacker Rank_
- Counting Valleys _from Hacker Rank_
- RepeatedString _from Hacker Rank_
- Jumping On The Clouds _from Hacker Rank_

## Swift
- Two Sum Problem
