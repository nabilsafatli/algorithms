 Lilah has a string, S, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
 Given an integer, N, find and print the number of letter a's in the first N letters of Lilah's infinite string.
 For example, if the string S='abcac' and N=10 , the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string.
 There are 4 occurrences of A in the substring.
