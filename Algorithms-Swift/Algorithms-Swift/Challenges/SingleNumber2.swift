/*
 Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once.
 Find that single one.
 
 Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

 Example 1:
 Input: [2,2,3,2]
 Output: 3

 Example 2:
 Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
 Output: 99
